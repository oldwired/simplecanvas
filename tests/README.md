# Browser regression checks

The application still runs by opening `index.html`; these dependencies are only for development.

Install the test tools with `npm install` and `npx playwright install chromium`, then run `npm test`.
To use an existing Chromium-based browser, set `BROWSER_EXECUTABLE` to its executable path.
For WebKit, install `npx playwright install webkit`, then run `BROWSER_ENGINE=webkit npm test`.

Tests run the complete application in isolated browser profiles. A diagnostic evaluator is added
to the served test copy to seed scenes and inspect state. Interactions and rendering use the actual
application functions; no diagnostic hooks are shipped in `index.html`.

Keep a test when it protects against lost drawings, broken file/clipboard output, or a distinct
editing regression. Prefer user actions and downloaded artifacts with independently checked results.
Cover shared behavior once; add another case only when it exercises a different failure path.
Avoid tests for removed buttons, routine styling, internal object identities, or two helpers
agreeing with one another. Do not multiply the same gesture sequence across viewport sizes.

Clipboard tests intercept the browser's clipboard write and replay its real JSON/PNG payloads through
paste events, so they do not change the OS clipboard. HTML tests open actual exported files and check
embedded assets, tab switching, group transforms, and current document data after storage failures.
Markdown checks cover cropped PNG/SVG/clipboard output and editor alignment. Native Office paste
still requires a manual integration check.

An iPad-sized touch scenario exercises endpoint cycling and double-tap point editing in Chromium
and WebKit. Mouse checks cover undo/reload/import, curve tangents, and preserving heads during drags.
The raw touch-drag test uses Chromium's CDP interface and is skipped in WebKit. A physical iPad
Safari pass is still needed before release to check native touch behavior and the on-screen keyboard.
